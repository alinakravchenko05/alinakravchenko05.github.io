            <h2>Event Report:</h2>
            <p>On 24 October, our team went to the Chemical and Biological Lyceum to take part in the Hour of Code event. We entered the 7th-grade classroom with 24 students at 8:30. 
                <br><br>We gave a brief introduction to ourselves and discussed ADA University in an interesting presentation at the start of the event. 
                <br><br>Our focus has been on teaching the basics of coding, using the platform https://studio.code.org/hoc/1. We provided them with a presentation that outlined the coding process. 
                <br><br>Then we demonstrated to them how to solve the first levels, explaining the structure and the foundation for their coding. Although 11 students were already familiar with the puzzles, of course, if they had questions, we were happy to help them. Through the workshop, the children had so much fun, demonstrating their new-found coding skills. For them, solving puzzles became more than just an educational exercise, it became enjoyable. 
                <br><br>At the end of our event, each of the kids received a certificate for participation in the Hour of Code and for completing the puzzles.</p>
